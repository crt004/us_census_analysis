# us_census_analysis


The analysis is split into two scripts:


	- census_1.R : Analysis of the train dataset
	
	- census_2.R : Training and testing of models
	

The whole code has comments describing each step, and has a complement to those comments here are some points:


	- in the "reports" folder there is a file called "rapidminer_train_statistics.png", 
	this is the result of the statistical analysis made with the RapidMiner tool, 
	the scripts does not generate this image.

	- The "missing_values_graphic" file, also in the reports folder, it is generated by the script, 
	but is commented due to the large amount of time that takes the library to generate the image,
	the graphic represents the amount of missing values in the data vs the values filled,
	the image generated is not very "pretty", but is a good indicator for compare this values in a graphic way (extra info wont hurt).

	- The "resulting_tree.ps" is a graphic of the tree model that had been chosen has the one with the highest performance,
	unfortunately the graphic is not very readable, maybe it would have been better to use another library for this.

	- The analysis of the features are split into two folders, one for the categorical_variables, 
	and another for the continuous_variables.

	- !!!! A warning when running the models script: the SVM model takes around 7~8 hours to finish,
	it might be better to run the scripts by blocks, the same is well split by the comments.
